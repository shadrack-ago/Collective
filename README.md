## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Supabase account ([sign up here](https://supabase.com))

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for your project to be set up (this takes ~2 minutes)
3. Go to Project Settings > API to find your credentials

### 3. Create Database Tables

1. In your Supabase project, navigate to the SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
3. Paste and run it in the SQL Editor
4. This will create all necessary tables, policies, and triggers

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

2. Fill in your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-email@example.com
```

### 5. Configure Email Authentication

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
2. Under **Email Auth**, enable:
   - Enable email confirmations
   - Confirm email
3. Set **Site URL** to: `http://localhost:3000` (development) or your production URL
4. Add redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Your production URL + `/auth/callback`

### 6. Set Up Admin Users

After creating your first user account:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
2. Find your user and copy the UUID
3. Go to Table Editor > profiles
4. Find your profile row and set `is_admin` to `true`

Alternatively, run this SQL in the SQL Editor (replace with your email):

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
